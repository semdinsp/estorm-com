        We have a web hosted point of sale solution that small retail and restaurants can use to deliver simple and easy to use POS capabilities. This is based on input from a small cafe owner and we expect to deploy it with telco operators in Indonesia who will provide it as  a bundled solution to their SME subscribers.

        This is currently under active development and features will be added frequently.

        Check back here for more information.
