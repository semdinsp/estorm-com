        We have built low cost terminals for lotteries based on Raspberry PI. This is allows us to create a terminal wth internet connectivity for less than $200 per terminal.

        In addition the terminal can manage money transfers, payments to service providers (eg telco's,utilities, etc)

        We have full proceses to manage cash collections from the distribution channels.
